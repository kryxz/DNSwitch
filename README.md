# DNSwitch

Easily manage and automatically switch your DNS profiles based on network conditions.


## Project Overview

**DNSwitch** simplifies managing your DNS settings. Automatically switch DNS profiles based on your Wi-Fi or cellular network to improve privacy, speed, and reliability.

It also solves the common issue with captive portals (login screens on public Wi-Fi at hotels, airports, or cafes). DNSwitch detects these automatically, temporarily switching to the default DNS so you can quickly log in, then restores your preferred settings.

### Key Features (Planned)

- Create and manage DNS profiles (custom and built-in)
- Automatic DNS switching based on network type or location
- Captive portal detection for public Wi-Fi logins
- Temporary DNS fallback for authentication
- iOS Shortcuts integration for quick switching
- Assign specific DNS profiles to individual networks
- Simple, intuitive user interface
